## Description
This is a portfolio showcaseing my ablity to build a website from scratch with samples of my photography included to use as placeholders as I work to complete web applications. With this website you can see a recent photo of myself with my dev name. When you click the links in the navigation, it scrolls to the corresponding sections. I made the site fuctional for desktops as well as smaller devices such as cell phones, ipads, etc.
